# Run chess.com torch engine as a standalone engine.

I used this to test the engine using CuteChess.

# Prerequisite:
## You must have NODEJS installed and in the PATH.

Download release: https://github.com/0wwafa/torch-v2/releases/latest

Or:
```
node dl.js

gcc torch-2.c -o torch-2
```

## just run `torch-2` or `torch-2.exe`

or add the directory and executable as an engine in CuteChess.
